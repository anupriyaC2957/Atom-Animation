# Atom-Animation
This CSS code implements an atom-inspired 3D animation, featuring three rotating circles, each containing a smaller ball. The design is centered within the viewport, and the circles rotate continuously around the Z-axis. Each ball within the circles also rotates, creating a dynamic and visually engaging atom-like effect. The animation utilizes 3D transformations and gradients to enhance the depth and aesthetic appeal of the atom animation.
